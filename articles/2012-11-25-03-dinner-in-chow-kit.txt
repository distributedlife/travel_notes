A small mob of us descended upon Chow Kit tonight. It's a poor area of the city known for cheap stuff and good eats a weathered look and no obvious
extravagence in the form of a luxury mall. Market stalls selling fruit and vegies snake along streets filled with a light crowd and few cars. 

We came for dinner and a light rain shower forced our hand and we ended up
in a restaurant that sat somewhere between a buffet, a cafeteria and a normal restaurant. I ordered something vegetarian and received an amazing dish with bean shoots, shreded cabbage, 
beans, baby bok choi in a slightly too spicy sauce containing freshly crushed peanuts covered in a mini prawn crackers. The prawn crackers were a little bit weird but I think they added a
nice textural element to the dish.
