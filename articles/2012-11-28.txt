I think my hotel staff get that I'm not from around here. However I don't think I get where I'm from. I returned from the client site today to find that the airconditioning had been set to the
lowest level possible; 10 degrees centigrade. I'm not sure why that's even a valid setting.


CHOW KIT
clearly citrus
if someone gave you a suitcase and asked you to hold it; what questions would you want to ask them
the acronym place

30/11
- the first 6 rows of the bus are two abreast with an isle down the middle. the next six are three single seats with two isles either side of the centre seat. The back row is five seats.
- picked a direction
- asked at the service station
- turned around to see the hotel sign
- the tropicana was full
- wandered around trying to find other hotels
- asked at the train station
- turned around to see hotel signs!
- the first was the shabbiest hotel i've ever seen, no one at the counter. I try the bell
- the second was run down, spartan but clean. No one at the counter, I waited. I saw a westerner go into a room while I wait.
- the buzzers don't work are being ignored
- back to tropicana No!
- back to shabby - empty
- back to run down motel
- sleep on couch in reception; or do I find a karoake place I walked past earlier; could I sleep in a booth?
- try to sleep on couch in the hope of being awoken and told to get a room
- some residents tell me to use the buzzer. Just one more try they say.
- I knock on the door of the westerner and ask to sleep on the floor.
- His name is tim and he is from st. louis in missouri. A teacher in KL
- It's not the worst night sleep i've ever had but the concrete floor is the worst bed I've ever slept on. He gives me a pillow 
--- and lets me have the blanket. The blanket serves as a cocoon to ward of the maruading mosquitos.

2/12
- amazing roti
- bright coloured houses (yellow, purple, blue)
- the deserted beach. Only on a friday according to my taxi driver
- daku and the really nice lade in the market give me free desert (saba) and fruit.
- the mall (toilet, separate lines for payment)
- the severe guy in charge
- the sleepy taxi driver on the way to the airport

5/12
- going to the movies
- only 2 previews in about 30 minutes of advertising before the film
- 12 ringgit ticket
- 8 ringgit for salty popcorn & ice lemon tea (sweet). Default is caramel and lite and sweet being the 3rd choice
- their popcorn is comically small. A small being not much larger than a can of coke. A large is an australian small. It's still more than enough popcorn; although mine didn't make the film as
--- as there were so many ads
- the arts industry will collapse and with it society - don't pirate message
- the thank you for paying to watch this film (actually a good message)
- the audience has tiny bladders with people getting up constantly during the film
- the usher opened the door before the film had arleady finished. not much in the way of immersion.
- freezing!

- MALL WALKERS!

7/12
- raining on the way to the airport; motocycle riders huddled under a bridge passing the time
