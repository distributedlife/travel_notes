Each day we take a taxi to and from the client site. The mornings are usually ok but the evenings are shining examples of KL traffic jams. The drivers here have an interesting technique where
they emphasise using the clutch over accelleration and braking. I don't just mean for stop-starts; we can go the entire 25 minute journey in second gear.

It could be that clutch plates are cheaper than brakes. Or it could be a result of the typical usage pattern. Someone needs to make a low-cost, no-frills, efficient taxi-car with only one gear 
optimised for city driving and traffic jams. A fixie-taxi. Paint it black and give it it's own style and
the hipsters will go mad for it.
