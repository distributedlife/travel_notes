So Per and I are wearily wandering the Midvalley Megamall for tennis balls for the agile game we will run tomorrow. We find a packet containing three tins of tennis balls; each tin contains three balls.
The packet costs 17.90 ringgit. A definate bargain considering the balls ended up being proper tennis balls packed in air-tight tins! We wander up to the till and the total comes to 75.18.

"What? I thought these were 17.90"

"The price is per tin sir, and there is three price tags on the packet. One for each tin."

My mind suitably boggled I pay the full amount (which, if you do the math, generously includes a 30% discount for some arbitrary reason).

It's lucky the don't price 'hundreds and thousands' that way.
