I saw a nice bag in shop in the Megamall tonight. I ducked into the shop and explored the bag playing the where-did-they-hide-the-price-tag game. 
I found it but it didn't have a price, just a model number.

"How much is this bag?" I ask.

She comes over and looks at the model number: "776 ringgit". Who in this country can afford 776 ($256) ringgit
for a bag? It wasn't even made of fancy material like massaged leather from rare cows
raised in the remote hinterlands of some boutique european country. It was almost entirely made from synthetic fibres.
