It's my birthday today. I'm a spritely 32. I took the train into KLCC to see what was there. On the way we passed three passenger carriages of a train that had been derailed. It appeared recent as 
workers were looking at it and taking photos. I'm sure it would have been unsettling for those on board but KL trains have a protection against serious accidents. It's known as not going very fast.
