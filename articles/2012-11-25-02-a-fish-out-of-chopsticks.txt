I felt a bit out of place. I sat in a foodcourt eating a Nyonan laksa using chopsticks and tāngchí (湯匙) which is the Chinese soup spoon. I looked about me and realised that all the 
locals were using a fork and spoon to eat their own laksa. They weren't even using it properly either. They use the fork like a shovel rather than twirling the noodles around the tangs as
you do with spagetti noodles; which were indeed the noodles being used in the laksa. If you follow the theory that pasta originated in China then we've almost come full circle; Italian pasta noodles 
in Malaysian Laksa.
